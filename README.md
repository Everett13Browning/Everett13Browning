## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Iâ€™m a front-end developer passionate about improving web accessibility and building modern, user-friendly web applications. My focus is on ensuring that websites are accessible to everyone, including people with disabilities, while also leveraging the latest technologies like React to build fast and responsive Progressive Web Apps (PWAs).

Accessibility is a top priority in my development process. I use ARIA roles and attributes to enhance web accessibility, ensuring that websites are usable by individuals relying on assistive technologies like screen readers. I believe that creating inclusive experiences benefits all users, and I strive to follow WCAG guidelines and best practices to make digital content more accessible to a wider audience. Whether it's improving keyboard navigation, ensuring proper labeling of elements, or making dynamic content accessible, I aim to implement solutions that support users with varying abilities.

Alongside accessibility, Iâ€™m also focused on building Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) using React. PWAs provide a seamless experience across different devices by combining the best features of both web and native mobile apps. With React, Iâ€™m able to create fast, responsive interfaces that work reliably even in challenging network conditions. I use service workers, caching strategies, and push notifications to deliver an app-like experience, allowing users to access content offline and enjoy faster load times.

In this repository, youâ€™ll find various projects that highlight my work on accessibility enhancements, PWA features, and React development. My goal is to contribute reusable, modular code that helps others improve accessibility and performance in their own applications.

Feel free to explore, offer feedback, or collaborate on projects related to accessibility and web development. Letâ€™s work together to create a more inclusive web.
